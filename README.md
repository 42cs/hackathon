Ideas from CS42 Week 5 that can work with Flask + HTML:
 
RandomExamPractice - Get a random practice problem or midterm every time you load the exam. (Can make it real time really quickly with a quick script) 

RandomGifChooser - Loads a random GIF in full screen (with submission) - Based off the Flask Starter Project

YoutubeSubmission - Submit related youtube videos and watch them with this interface. 
ShareYoutube - Realtime requires some JS knowledge but not much. 

StudyTIME - Flask Web App to schedule a time to study/meetup for a specific topic/class
(side note: like pandascheduler but simpler) 

TrackChanges - Updates you when a website changes. (Think telebears or cs61 project releases) 

Something Fun with Twilio (An API to send SMS/make calls) 

FreeFoooooood - Tracks what events have free food on campus. 

- A compiler that turns an outline into an essay
- A Chrome plugin that turns all of my currently open tabs into a Works Cited page
